Cloud Formation
- Gives users an easy way to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion.
- Template: Architectural diagram. JSON or YAML format.
- Stack: End result of that diagram (what is actually provisioned).
- Create, update, delete collection of resources by creating, updating and deleting stacks using CF templates.
- Use when trying to turn infrastructure into code and provision stacks across multiple regions.
- More powerful and customizable than EB.

Template Elements:
- Mandatory:
  . List of AWS resources and their associated configuration values.
- Optional:
  . Template's file format and version number.
  . Template parameters: Input values supplied at stack creation time (limit of 60).
  . Output values: Output values required once stack has finished building (limit of 60).
  . List of data tables: Used to look up static configuration values (such as AMI's. etc).

Exam Tips:
- Be default, automatic rollback on error feature is enabled.
- Your are charged for errors.
- You pay for the resources that you use, but CF is free.
- Stacks can wait for apps to be provisioned using the WaitCondition.
- You can wait use Fn:GetAtt to output data.
- Route53 is completely supported (includes creating new hosted zones or updating).
- You can create A Records, Aliases, etc.
- IAM Role Creation and Assignment is supported.
