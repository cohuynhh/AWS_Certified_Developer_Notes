AWS Databases

(Currently 5)
-RDS (Relational Database System)
-DynamoDB
-ElastiCache
-Amazon Redshift
-Database Migration System


RDS: not much in the exam
	-SQL Server
	-Oracle
	-MySQL
	-PostgreSQL
	-Aurora
	-MariaDB 

Non RDB
	- Document
	- JSON

Data Warehousing
	- Used for business intelligence
	- Used to pull in very large and complex datasets

Data Warehousing vs RDS
	-Online Transaction Processing vs Online Analytics Processing:
		OLTP: Differs from OLAP in the types of queries run. Pulls row data
		OLAP: Analyze a large volume of information. Gathers patterns and shows tendencies. Pulls in large number of records.
	-Datawarehousing: Use different type of architecture both from a database and infrastructure layer. In order to maximize query times.

Elasticache
	Makes easier to deploy, operate and scale in-memory cache in the cloud
	Increases performance by allowing the retrieve from a memory caches which are faster than slow disk based databases.
	Supports:
		- Memcached
		- Redis
	Will cache the most consistent queried aspects of a DB

DMS 
	Allows to migrate production databases into AWS. Once it is started it is managed by AWS, aspects like: compression, transformation and parallel transfer.
	Data changes to the source are replicated on the target. That is new data will also be migrated
	Aws conversion Tool:
		- Converts Schemas, views, stored proc, functions to a format compatible with the target database.
