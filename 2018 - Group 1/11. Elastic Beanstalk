Elastic Beanstalk
- Service to deploy, monitor and scale an application quickly, through a GUI.
- Highly abstract focus towards infrastructure.
- Attempts to remove or significantly simplify infrastructure management.
- Use when user has not much experience on AWS.

Key Architecture Components:
- Applications:
  . Applications are the high level structure in beanstalk.
  . Your entire app is one EB app or each logical component can be a EB app or a EB environment within an app.
- Environments:
  . Apps can have multiple environments (prod, test, dev) or functional type (FE, BE).
  . Environments are single instance or scalable.
  . Environments are either web server environments or worker environments.
- Versions:
  . App versions are unique packages which represent versions of apps.
  . An app is uploaded as a bundle (.zip).
  . Each app can have many versions (1:M relationship).
  . App versions can de deployed to environments within an app.

Exam Tips:
- Multiple versions of your app.
- Your apps can be split into tiers (Web tier/application tier/database tier).
- You can update your app.
- You can update your configuration.
- Updates can be one instance at a time, a % of instances (rolling) or an immutable update.
- You pay for the resources that you use, but EB is free.
- If EB creates your RDS DB then it will delete it when you delete your app. If not, then the RDS instance stays.
- Platforms:
  . Preconfigured: .NET (IIS), Java (Tomcat), Node.js (NGinx or Apache HTTP), PHP (Apache HTTP), Python (Apache HTTP), Ruby (Passenger or Puma), Tomcat, Go, Packer.
  . Preconfigured - Docker: Glassfish, Go, Python.
  . Generic: Docker, Multi container Docker.
